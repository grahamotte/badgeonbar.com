## Code Moto

This repo is based on Code Moto. Code Moto is a basis/template repository that provides tools and patterns for downstream repositories. From a downstream repository, the basis repository is typically available at `../CodeMoto`. If the current repository is named `CodeMoto`, changes affect the Code Moto framework itself.

Repositories based on Code Moto may omit components or add their own. Backport broadly useful tools and changes to `CodeMoto` when practical.

The "Repo Specific" section blow contains rules specific to this repo only.

## Project Rules

1. Do not introduce bugs or regressions.
2. Before writing code, find analogous code in the repository and follow its established patterns.
3. Do not add comments to code. Preserve existing comments unless they are incorrect or obsolete.
4. Lint, type-check, and test code changes using the tasks defined in the root `mise.toml`.
5. Use root `mise` tasks instead of invoking underlying tools directly when an applicable task exists.
6. Do not create a canvas or visualization unless the user specifically requests one.
7. When opening a git worktree, copy `.env.development`, `.env.production`, and `backend/db/schema.rb` from the main checkout into the worktree before running tests or mise tasks.
8. All code changes and other changes to tracked repository files need a PR, pushed with `mr push` and opened with `mr pr create`. Operations without tracked repository changes need no PR, empty commit, or branch. Never commit to or push `master`, and never make repository changes outside the PR flow.
9. Work from `origin/master`: start branches from it, and do not rely on local `master` being current.
10. If you spend significant time unnecessarily or the instructions misdirect you, and the issue could be backported to Code Moto (`CodeMoto` / MOTO), report it with enough detail for Mr. Moto to track the basis-repository follow-up. Keep app-specific issues separate.
11. On macOS, run root `mise` tasks from the worktree root in a non-login shell. For Codex `exec_command`, set `login: false` explicitly on each call that runs `mise`, including through wrappers. If Bundler reports system Ruby or a missing Bundler version, check tool resolution and retry the same root task this way before changing dependencies. See [macOS agent task execution](docs/manager.md#macos-agent-task-execution).

## Ruby

- Use `.blank?` and `.present?` for presence checks instead of `.empty?`, `.nil?`, or truthiness checks.
- Do not use `sleep`; use an event- or state-based approach instead.
- Add trailing commas to multiline argument lists and collections.

## TypeScript

- Treat nullable values as both `null` and `undefined`; use `nullish()` in Zod schemas and check for both states.
- Use `pnpm`, not `npm`.
- Use `mise tsc` to type-check.
- Prefer Lodash utilities over custom equivalents when Lodash is already available.
- Use shadcn/ui components.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Testing

- Never run network requests, system commands, or application sleeps in tests. Stub those boundaries every time.
- Do not stub other units in a unit test. Only stub network requests, system commands, and sleeps so the real local collaborators and full local surface are exercised together.
- Every business-logic file must have one corresponding unit test file. Source and test files are 1:1.
- Test each business-logic unit thoroughly. Configuration, generated files, framework shells, and other files without business logic do not need tests.
- After every code change, run the whole suite with `mise test`.
- Do not write integration tests.

## Session instructions

Use `origin` as the sole workflow repository remote, preserving its hosting provider and actual default branch. A Code Moto basis remote named `codemoto` and an optional `deployment` remote may also be present. Do not add mirrors or alternate origin names. Fetch before updating default branches, use fast-forward-only pulls, and never force-push a default branch.

For card work, use Mr. Moto's `mr` CLI: run `mr card claim <CARD>` and follow its output, and see `mr --help` for the rest. This repository provides implementation instructions, checks, and operation tooling.

## File Structure

- `.agents/skills/` - Project-specific agent skills.
- `.claude/skills` - Symlink to `.agents/skills/` for Claude Code.
- `.env.default` - Template for the `.env.*` secret files.
- `.env.*` - Gitignored secrets, identifiers issued or rotated with them, and `RAILS_ENV`/`NODE_ENV`. Do not expose secret values. Mr. Moto generates them from 1Password with its `secrets` command; each item stores one concealed field per env key, labeled with the key name, and the file follows the `.env.default` layout with extra keys at the end.
- `apps/` - Mobile apps for iOS and Android.
- `assets/` - Shared images and media.
- `backend/` - Ruby on Rails API server.
- `config.json` - Non-secret configuration, including mobile app release (`apps`) and website subdomain (`subdomains`) settings. Code reads it directly instead of `ENV`.
- `deploy/` - Backend and frontend deployment tooling.
- `docs/` - Project documentation in Markdown.
- `frontend/` - React website.
- `gems/` - Shared Ruby gems.
- `manager/` - Project tooling for spawning new apps and Code Moto merges.
- `publish/` - Mobile app versioning, simulators, and App Store publishing. `mise keychain` restores the user keychain search list after a killed signing run and runs before `mise publish`; `mise keychain --repair` resets the login keychain, default keychain, and search list.
- `scripts/` - General-purpose scripts. `scripts/mise/` holds the scripts behind multi-line `mise.toml` tasks.
- `mise.toml` - Project tooling and task definitions.

## Repo Specific

### Deployment

This repository is not deployed. Do not run `mise deploy` or the `deploy` skill. The `deploy/` tooling is inherited from Code Moto and unused.

### Badge On Bar

Badge On Bar reads other apps' Dock badge counts through the macOS Accessibility API and mirrors selected badges into separate menu bar items. It is a native macOS menu bar accessory: no Dock icon and no main window unless configuration is open. It is distributed as a signed and notarized repository release, not through the App Store.

### Apple App Architecture

- The app source is in `apps/apple/App`; the Xcode project is `apps/apple/App.xcodeproj`.
- `BadgeMonitor` owns Dock Accessibility polling, running and installed app discovery, and badge values.
- `AppSettings` is the single source of truth for persisted defaults and per-app overrides.
- `AppSettings` seeds defaults for newly discovered apps, removes stale overrides, and invokes its change callback after every persisted output mutation.
- `StatusBarManager` owns `NSStatusItem` lifecycle, click handling, icons, and badge rendering.
- `ConfigurationView` consumes `AppSettings` and `BadgeMonitor` through SwiftUI environment observation.
- `BadgeOnBarApp` and `AppDelegate` own activation policy, the configuration window, permissions startup, and lifecycle glue.
- Keep AppKit and Accessibility work on `@MainActor`. Use callbacks between AppKit managers and observable state.

### Monitoring and Display Behavior

- Start monitoring only after Accessibility trust is granted.
- When Accessibility trust changes, start or stop monitoring immediately so stale badge state is cleared after permission is revoked.
- Poll Dock badge values once per second; use AX observation only to invalidate the Dock element cache.
- Preserve `-1` as the non-empty, non-integer badge value.
- Resolve Dock entries from AX filename or URL, running app identity, bundle display name, then the installed app registry.
- Create and remove status items synchronously in `StatusBarManager.sync()` and always set `autosaveName` to `BadgeOnBar_<bundleID>`.
- Preserve badge, dot, count, and question display modes plus show, greyscale, and hide zero behavior.
- Resize icons by drawing into a new `NSImage`; do not use TIFF round-trips.
- Preserve the legacy dot-setting migration shims in `AppSettings`.

### Apple Workflow

- `mise test` runs the repository suite, including portable `AppSettings` tests.
- Use `mise simulate macos` to build and launch the app and `mise xcode` to open the project.
- Use `$publish` for versioning and the signed, notarized GitHub release workflow.
- Keep the app dependency-free and the configuration UI compact, native, and settings-first.
